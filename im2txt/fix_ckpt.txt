A few people are having trouble using @psycharo 's trained checkpoint since the release of TF 1.0. Here are the steps you can follow.

Upgrade to the latest version of TensorFlow and fetch the latest version of this repository.

Firstly the word_counts.txt file provided above was generated with Python 3, so it wrote all the words like this: b'word'. You may need to rewrite that file. The following code worked for me on Python 
2.7; you may have to tweak if you are using something different.

OLD_VOCAB_FILE = "word_counts.txt"
NEW_VOCAB_FILE = "word_counts2.txt"

with open(OLD_VOCAB_FILE) as f:
  lines = list(f.readlines())

def clean_line(line):
  tokens = line.split()
  return "%s %s" % (eval(tokens[0]), tokens[1])

newlines = [clean_line(line) for line in lines]

with open(NEW_VOCAB_FILE, "w") as f:
  for line in newlines:
    f.write(line + "\n")

Now we need to rename 2 of the variables in the checkpoint file.

OLD_CHECKPOINT_FILE = ".../model.ckpt-2000000"
NEW_CHECKPOINT_FILE = ".../model.ckpt-2000000"

import tensorflow as tf
vars_to_rename = {
    "lstm/BasicLSTMCell/Linear/Matrix": "lstm/basic_lstm_cell/weights",
    "lstm/BasicLSTMCell/Linear/Bias": "lstm/basic_lstm_cell/biases",
}
new_checkpoint_vars = {}
reader = tf.train.NewCheckpointReader(OLD_CHECKPOINT_FILE)
for old_name in reader.get_variable_to_shape_map():
  if old_name in vars_to_rename:
    new_name = vars_to_rename[old_name]
  else:
    new_name = old_name
  new_checkpoint_vars[new_name] = tf.Variable(reader.get_tensor(old_name))

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
saver = tf.train.Saver(new_checkpoint_vars)

with tf.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(init)
  saver.save(sess, NEW_CHECKPOINT_FILE)
Now it should work!

CHECKPOINT_PATH=".../model-renamed.ckpt-2000000"
VOCAB_FILE=".../word_counts2.txt"
IMAGE_FILE=".../COCO_val2014_000000224477.jpg"
